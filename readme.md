## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **AI-powered visual search engine** capable of finding visually similar images from a large database without using any text tags or metadata.

It leverages **Deep Metric Learning** using a **Triplet Network** architecture. The core model is built on a pre-trained **MobileNetV2** backbone, which learns to map images into a 128-dimensional embedding space where similar items (e.g., two different watches) are clustered closely together.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Visual Similarity Search:** Upload an image to find the top *k* most visually similar items from the database.
* **Deep Learning Model:** Uses a Siamese-style Triplet Network trained with **Triplet Loss**.
* **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes **MobileNetV2** (pre-trained on ImageNet) for robust feature extraction.
* **Efficient Retrieval:** Implements **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** for fast embedding search.
* **Custom Dataset Support:** Designed to handle custom, folder-structured image datasets.

## 📂 Dataset Structure

The system expects a dataset organized by class folders. For example:

```text
MY_DATASET/
├── watch/
│   ├── watch_01.jpg
│   ├── watch_02.jpg
│   └── ...
├── laptop/
│   ├── laptop_01.jpg
│   └── ...
└── jacket/
    ├── jacket_01.jpg
    └── ...
Note: The code automatically handles (Anchor, Positive, Negative) triplet generation from this directory structure.🏗️ Model ArchitectureThe system uses a Triplet Network architecture:Input: Three images are fed into the network:Anchor (A): Reference image.Positive (P): Same class as Anchor.Negative (N): Different class from Anchor.Base Network (Shared Weights): Each image passes through the same MobileNetV2 backbone (frozen) + Custom Head (GlobalAveragePooling -> Dense -> L2 Normalization).Embedding: The network outputs a 128-dimensional vector for each image.Loss Function: The model minimizes Triplet Loss:$$L(A, P, N) = \max(d(A, P) - d(A, N) + \alpha, 0)$$Where $d$ is the Euclidean distance and $\alpha$ is the margin.💻 Installation & Usage1.
